                        The house and our bedroom we're just great. It really felt homey, especially with Puss and Boots
                        coming in and out of our room, haha. Emily has some extra special touches for us and our few
                        moments seeing each other during our stay she was just the sweetest. The house was in a great
                        area and close to some really awesome spots we ate at. Would absolutely come back if I were in
                        the city again!
