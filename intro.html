       <p id="one">When Nicole Poindexter left the energy efficiency focused startup, Opower  a few months after the company’s public offering, she wasn’t sure what would come next.</p>
       <p id="two">What does it take to have 100 percent renewables on the grid in the US at the time was not a solvable problem,” Poindexter said. “I looked to Africa and I’d heard that there weren’t many grid assets [so] maybe I could try this idea out there. As I was doing market research, I learned what life was like without electricity and I was like.. that’s not acceptable and I can do something about it.”</p>
